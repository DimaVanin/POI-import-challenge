# POI import challenge

## Overview

The **POI import service** is a critical component within our microservice architecture, responsible for retrieving Point of Interest (POI) data from OpenChargeMap and making it available to other services. The service must prioritize reliability, accessibility, and error resistance, as it serves as the primary source of POI data for the entire system.

1. Data Import: The service will be designed to efficiently import POI data from OpenChargeMap, handling authentication, data transformation, and error handling to ensure the accurate and complete retrieval of information.

2. Robustness and Reliability: The service will be engineered to withstand potential failures, employing strategies such as fault tolerance, retries, and circuit breaking to maintain reliability even under adverse conditions.

3. Accessibility: The service will provide well-designed and easily accessible API endpoints for other services to request POI data, ensuring seamless integration within the microservice architecture.

4. Scalability: The service will be architected to scale effectively as the system's demand for POI data evolves, thus guaranteeing the seamless expansion of its capabilities alongside the overall system growth.

5. Monitoring and Logging: Comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms will be integrated into the service to track imports, data availability, performance, and any potential issues, enabling proactive management and maintenance.

By adhering to these foundational principles, the POI import service will establish itself as a dependable, responsive, and resilient component within the microservice architecture, fostering the seamless operation of the entire system.
